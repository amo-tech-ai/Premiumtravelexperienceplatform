- ✓ Use checklists
- ✓ Verify before shipping
- ✓ Follow existing patterns
- ✓ Check for errors systematically

### Response Format
- ✓ Brief (1-2 sentences max)
- ✓ Checklist format
- ✓ No long explanations
- ✓ Move on quickly

### Forensic Audit
- ✓ Check imports exist
- ✓ Verify paths correct
- ✓ Test all user flows
- ✓ 100% production ready
- ✓ Fix before shipping

### Design System
- ✓ Wireframe first (ASCII)
- ✓ Implementation plan second
- ✓ Checklists throughout
- ✓ Mermaid diagrams for flow
- ✓ Verify at every step

### Animations
- ✓ Only `opacity` and `transform`
- ✓ Duration: 200-600ms
- ✓ Easing: ease-out (most cases)
- ✓ Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- ✓ Test on real devices
